# DataBase-Management-System

This is a data base engine simulation using java which provides basic DBMS functionality such as insert, update, delete, select, creation of tables
and B+ trees.
The supported types are Java.lang.Integer, Java.lang.Double, Java.lang.String, Java.lang.Boolean, Java.util.Date, Java.awt.polygon.
The DB engine performs some query optimizations, it performs linear(seq) scan, binary search and Index scan using B+ trees when appropriate.
Note:
In this implementation we compare polygons using areas.
